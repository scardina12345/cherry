<p>
In this video, we'll discuss the focus of the first four domains:<br>
security and risk management, asset security,<br>
security architecture and engineering, and communication and network security.<br>
The first domain is SECURITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT<br>
There are several areas of focus for this domain:<br>
defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation,<br>
compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.<br>
Let's discuss each area of focus in more detail.<br>
By defining security goals and objectives,<br>
organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data<br>
like PII, or personally identifiable information.<br>
Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules<br>
in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.<br>
Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal<br>
security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.<br>
Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain<br>
their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.<br>
And finally, while laws related to security and<br>
risk management are different worldwide, the overall goals are similar.<br>
As a security professional, this means following rules and expectations for<br>
ethical behavior to minimize negligence, abuse, or fraud.<br>
The next domain is ASSET SECURITY<br>
The asset security domain is focused on securing digital and physical assets.<br>
It's also related to the storage, maintenance,<br>
retention, and destruction of data.<br>
This means that assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and<br>
protected, whether stored on a computer, transferred over<br>
a network like the internet, or even physically collected.<br>
Organizations also need to have policies and procedures that ensure<br>
data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed.<br>
Knowing what data you have and who has access to it is necessary for having<br>
a strong security posture that mitigates risk to critical assets and data.<br>
Previously, we provided a few examples that touched on the disposal of data.<br>
For example, an organization might have you, as a security analyst, oversee<br>
the destruction of hard drives to make sure that they're properly disposed of.<br>
This ensures that private data stored on those drives can't be accessed by<br>
threat actors.<br>
The third domain is security ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING<br>
This domain is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools,<br>
systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.<br>
One of the core concepts of secure design architecture is shared responsibility.<br>
Shared responsibility means that all individuals within<br>
an organization take an active role in lowering risk and<br>
maintaining both physical and virtual security.<br>
By having policies that encourage users to recognize and<br>
report security concerns, many issues can be handled quickly and effectively.<br>
The fourth domain is COMMUNICATION AND NETWORK SECURITY  which is mainly<br>
focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.<br>
Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe<br>
whether on-site, or in the cloud, or when connecting to services remotely.<br>
For example, employees working remotely in public spaces need to be<br>
protected from vulnerabilities that can occur when they use<br>
insecure bluetooth connections or public wifi hotspots.<br>
By having security team members remove access to those types of communication<br>
channels at the organizational level, employees may be discouraged from<br>
practicing insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors.<br>
Now that we've reviewed the focus of our first four domains,<br>
let's discuss the last four domains.

<br>
<br>
<p>
The fifth domain is identity and access <br>
 IDENTY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT  IAM.<br>
And it's focused on access and authorization to keep data secure by<br>
making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.<br>
As an entry-level analyst, it's essential to keep an organization's systems and data<br>
as secure as possible by ensuring user access is limited to what employees need.<br>
Basically, the goal of IAM is to reduce the overall risk to systems and data.<br>
For example, if everyone at a company is using the same administrator login,<br>
there is no way to track who has access to what data.<br>
In the event of a breach,<br>
separating valid user activity from the threat actor would be impossible.<br>
There are four main components to IAM.<br>
Identification is when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name,<br>
an access card, or biometric data such as a fingerprint.<br>
Authentication is the verification process to prove a person's<br>
identity, such as entering a password or PIN.<br>
Authorization takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and<br>
relates to their level of access, which depends on the role in the organization.<br>
Accountability refers to monitoring and recording user actions,<br>
like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The sixth security domain isSECURITY ASSESSMENT AND TESTING	<br>
This domain focuses on conducting security control testing,<br>
collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for<br>
risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.<br>
Security control testing can help an organization identify new and<br>
better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.<br>
This involves examining organizational goals and objectives, and<br>
evaluating if the controls being used actually achieve those goals.<br>
Collecting and analyzing security data regularly also helps prevent threats and<br>
risks to the organization. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Analysts might use security control testing evaluations and security<br>
assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement new controls.<br>
An example of implementing a new control could be requiring the use of multi-factor<br>
authentication to better protect the organization from potential threats and risks.<br>
Next, let's discuss 
</p>
<br>
<p>
SECURITY OPERATIONS
</p>
<br>
<p>
The security operations domain is focused on conducting investigations and<br>
implementing preventative measures.<br>
Investigations begin once a security incident has been identified.<br>
This process requires a heightened sense of urgency in order to minimize<br>
potential risks to the organization.<br>
If there is an active attack, mitigating the attack and<br>
preventing it from escalating further is essential for<br>
ensuring that private information is protected from threat actors.<br>
Once the threat has been neutralized, the collection of digital and physical<br>
evidence to conduct a forensic investigation will begin.<br>
A digital forensic investigation must take place to identify<br>
when, how, and why the breach occurred.<br>
This helps security teams determine areas for improvement and<br>
preventative measures that can be taken to mitigate future attacks. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The eighth and final security domain is 
</p>
<br>
<p>
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SECUIRTY<br>
This domain focuses on using secure coding practices.<br>
As you may remember, secure coding practices are recommended guidelines<br>
that are used to create secure applications and services.<br>
The software development lifecycle is an efficient process used by teams to<br>
quickly build software products and features.<br>
In this process, security is an additional step.<br>
By ensuring that each phase of the software development lifecycle undergoes<br>
security reviews, security can be fully integrated into the software product.<br>
For example, performing a secure design review during the design phase,<br>
secure code reviews during the development and testing phases,<br>
and penetration testing during the deployment and implementation phase<br>
ensures that security is embedded into the software product at every step.<br>
This keeps software secure and sensitive data protected, and<br>
mitigates unnecessary risk to an organization.<br>
Being familiar with these domains can help you better understand how they're<br>
used to improve the overall security of an organization and<br>
the critical role security teams play.<br>
Next, we'll discuss security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities,<br>
including ransomware, and introduce you to the three layers of the web.
